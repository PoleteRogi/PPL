# PPL
A command-based easy-to-use programming language.
## Getting Started
To get started create a file ending with the *.ppl* file extension.
We are gonna do a basic "Hello world".
<br>
> *print "Hello World!"*
    
Now lets execute this command:
<br>
> *main.py {filename}.ppl*
   
It should show hello world.
